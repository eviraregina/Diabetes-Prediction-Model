# Diabetes-Prediction-Model
In this project, i explore how we can use Logistic Regression, KNeighborsClassifier, and GradientBostClassifier to build a prediction model that can predict diabetes. The datasets used is a Pima Diabetes Datasets, it can be downloaded here : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database.

This study aims to create prediction model that can predict if a person has a diabetes or not. The two method used will gives us a different accuracy score, and which method with the best accuracy score will be answer in this project.

# Introduction
Diabetes is a disease that occurs when your blood glucose, also called blood sugar, is too high. Blood glucose is your main source of energy and comes from the food you eat. Insulin, a hormone made by the pancreas, helps glucose from food get into your cells to be used for energy. Sometimes your body doesn’t make enough—or any—insulin or doesn’t use insulin well. Glucose then stays in your blood and doesn’t reach your cells. Over time, having too much glucose in your blood can cause health problems. Although diabetes has no cure, you can take steps to manage your diabetes and stay healthy.

# Context
This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.

# Content
The datasets consists of several medical predictor variables and one target variable, Outcome. Predictor variables includes the number of pregnancies the patient has had, their BMI, insulin level, age, and so on.

# Variables Description
Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant

Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test

BloodPressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)

SkinThickness: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)

Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)

BMI: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)

DiabetesPedigreeFunction: Diabetes pedigree function

Age: Age (years)

Outcome: Class variable (0 or 1) 268 of 768 are 1, the others are 0
