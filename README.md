# Diabetes-Prediction-Model
In this project, i explore how we can use Logistic Regression, KNeighborsClassifier, and GradientBostClassifier to build a prediction model that can predict diabetes. The datasets used is a Pima Diabetes Datasets, it can be downloaded here : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database.

This study aims to create prediction model that can predict if a person has a diabetes or not. The two method used will gives us a different accuracy score, and which method with the best accuracy score will be answer in this project.
